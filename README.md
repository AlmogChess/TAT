# Tester-Allocation-Tool

The project was written in React, its purpose is to allow engineers to request a tester to work on it.
The software requires the user to enter important details about the allocation.
And then the request is saved and displayed on the website.
This project helped us a lot because we progressed from an old and much less good method, 
in which we did not know details about the allocation
And as a result, the service was less good.
